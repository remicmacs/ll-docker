# ll-docker

Repository to store all configuration and files for a cluster running LearningLocker services.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This work is greatly inspired by [Micha≈Ç Zimniewicz's repo](https://github.com/michzimny/learninglocker2-docker).

And obviously it works thanks to the software provided by [LearningLocker](https://github.com/LearningLocker).

Makefile for Docker inspired by [Johnny Mkhael's project](https://github.com/jmkhael/make-for-docker).

NodeJS setup script is from [NodeSource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions)

## DISCLAIMER

This repo is a sandbox to develop a tool that fits my development needs. It is NOT suitable for production. I do not take responsability for any problems you might encounter with it, and I WILL NOT maintain it in the long run.

## How to use

Because the application is structured in **services**, this Docker port is structured in a _cluster_ orchestrated with `docker-compose`.

### Getting started

1. Build the base images
    * `ll-app` : the application itself
    * `ll-nginx`: the NGINX reverse proxy unifying access to all services in one place
2. `docker-compose up -d`
3. Profits!

A Makefile is provided for tedious build commands.

Build all things:

```bash
make build-all
```

Bring up the cluster

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Create a site administrator **(First time only)**:

```bash
docker-compose exec api node cli/dist/server createSiteAdmin [email] [organization name] [password]
```

Site is now available at `localhost`.

### Fine tuning the build process

Configuration is made with environment variables set in the `make.env` file. Some values will be overidden if not provided, other will not:

| Name      | Role                                     |  Default |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|----------|
|VERSION    |Tag for the future built version          |latest-dev|
|VERSION_NUM|Numerical tag for the future built version|          |
|DOCKER_ID  |Id for DockerHub images                   |          |
|IMAGE_NAME |Root name of the built images             |ll-app    |

Values can be overriden with command line interface:

```bash
make build-app DOCKER_ID=myawesomedockerid
```

To build only the web application:

```bash
make build-app
```

To build only NGINX:

```bash
make build-nginx
```

### Fine-tuning the cluster

@TODO : data persistance
@TODO : open ports for debugging.

## Improvements

As it is just a dev tool for my own purposes, I think lots of things could be improved, such as (but not limited to):

* Mail and SMTP management;
* Logging configuration
* Logs recovery
